security-at-home
================

This module runs network vulnerability scans and saves a PDF summary of the result locally on your machine. The primary scanning functionality uses base scans from NMAP, the canonical open-source network scanner. For certain wifi router models it will also probe the administrative page to see if it's been secured beyond the default username / password combination.
